1. Explain why adding and removing liquidity to your exchange does not change the exchange rate.


# TODO: answer question 1 here
because ratio of eth : token remains the same


2. Explain your scheme for rewarding liquidity providers and justify the design decisions you made. How does it satisfy the liquidity rewards requirements outlined in Section 7?


# TODO: answer question 2 here
